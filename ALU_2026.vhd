-- IMPORTANT
-- VHDL is strongly typed.
-- In VHDL, types do not just describe the size of a signal, they describe its meaning. 
-- A std_logic_vector means “a bundle of bits,” nothing more. 
-- A signed signal means “a two's complement number.” Because the language is strongly typed, VHDL won’t let you accidentally treat raw bits as a number or mix numeric and non-numeric types without being explicit.
-- In VHDL, you need to use the signed type for C2 (two’s-complement) arithmetic because arithmetic operators like +, -, and comparisons are only numerically defined for the signed and unsigned types in numeric_std, not for std_logic_vector. 
-- A std_logic_vector is just a collection of bits with no inherent numerical meaning, so the compiler has no way to know whether those bits represent a positive or negative number or how to interpret the sign bit.
-- By converting the operands to signed, you explicitly tell VHDL to interpret the MSB as the sign bit and to perform proper two’s-complement arithmetic. 
-- After the calculation, the result is typically converted back to std_logic_vector to store it in a register because registers and ports are often defined as std_logic_vector for generality and compatibility with other logic, interfaces, and synthesis tools. 
-- This separation keeps arithmetic correct and unambiguous while still allowing flexible storage and data movement.
-- NOTE: If you add additional registers you will have to adjust types
-- See the ACC_register for an example: 
-- 1) To use ACC_input as input, first it is transformed to std_logic_vector with: std_logic_vector(ACC_input)
-- 2) To use the output for signed arithmetic operations, first it is transformed to signed: else sum_total_ext + signed(ACC_out);
